# Chatbot with Fall Detection System

## Overview
This project combines a chatbot interface with a fall detection system, creating an assistive technology solution that can monitor for potential falls while providing interactive communication capabilities.

## Components

### Fall Detection System
The system monitors for potential falls using computer vision techniques and alerts when suspicious movements are detected. It identifies falls through:

- Sudden vertical drops (measuring the magnitude of downward movements)
- Unusual body aspect ratios (detecting when body proportions change significantly)

The system logs all potential fall events with detailed information including timestamps, detection methods, and measurement values.

### Chatbot Interface
The chatbot provides a natural language interface for:
- Receiving fall alerts
- Checking system status
- Configuring detection parameters
- Requesting assistance

## Files
- `fall_detection.log`: Contains timestamped records of all potential fall events detected by the system

## Usage
1. Start the fall detection monitoring system
2. Interact with the chatbot to receive alerts and control the system
3. Review logs for historical fall detection data

## Features
- Real-time fall detection with immediate alerts
- Natural language interaction through the chatbot
- Comprehensive logging system
- Multiple fall detection methods for improved accuracy

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- Required libraries (detailed in requirements.txt)
- Camera for fall detection monitoring

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with emergency services
- Mobile app companion
- Voice command capabilities
- Machine learning for improved fall detection accuracy
- Remote monitoring for caregivers
